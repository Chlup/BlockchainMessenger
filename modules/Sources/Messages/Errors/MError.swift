!!!!! To edit this file go to MErrorCodeDefinition first and udate/add codes. Then run generateErrorCode.sh script to regenerate this file.

By design each error should be used only at one place in the app. Thanks to that it is possible to identify exact line in the code from which the
error originates. And it can help with debugging.
